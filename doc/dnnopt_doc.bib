	Abstract = {QUANTUM ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, and projector-augmented wave). The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization . It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.},

	Abstract = {A comparison is made of the isotopic neutron sources 252 Cf and 238 Pu, Be for partial-body in vivo neutron activation analysis. Depth distributions of thermal neutron fluences in a water phantom are very similar for the two sources. The peak depth occurs at 5 cm. This value is approximately 2 cm less than the values obtained with uncollimated neutrons produced in broad-beam irradiations. With respect to the fluence-to-dose ratio, the 252 Cf neutrons have an advantage of approximately 1.4 over the 238 Pu, Be source. The use of 252 Cf offers two additional advantages for the investigator. First, it minimises the on-line fast-neutron damage in Ge(Li) semiconductor detectors. Secondly, it is subject to much less stringent transport regulations than 238 Pu, Be. The latter feature takes on particular importance in view of the increasing usefulness of transportable instruments for in vivo cadmium measurements at the workplace.},

The experiment has operated in a stable manner throughout this time period. All aspects of this detector are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the determination of the extraction and counting efficiencies, the key experimental parameters that are necessary to convert the measured 37 Ar count rate to the solar neutrino production rate. A thorough consideration is also given to the systematics of the detector, including the measurement of the extraction and counting efficiencies and the nonsolar production of 37 Ar. The combined result of 108 extractions is a solar neutrino-induced 37 Ar production rate of 2.56 $\pm$ 0.l6 (statistical) $\pm$ 0.16 (systematic) SNU.},

	Abstract = {We present new weak-lensing observations of 1E 0657-558 ( z = 0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST /ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

	Abstract = {Future searches for the neutrino-less double beta decay mode in candidate nuclei must confront the need for sensitivities at the level of 10 -- 50 meV effective neutrino mass. Current techniques may not be able to scale simultaneously to the needed mass of active isotope with both improved energy resolution and much higher levels of background rejection. To address these severe challenges, a novel approach based on a negative-ion time projection chamber filled primarily with high-pressure 136 Xe gas is developed. In addition to the provision of a nearly ideal active fiducial boundary surface, an energy resolution of ~5 × 10 3 FWHM appears possible at the Q-value of 2.48 MeV. The background rejection advantages of detailed track information and a single monolithic detector are addressed. A barium daughter-tagging scheme based on mobility differences and a new approach addressing the goal of efficient electron capture and release in high-density gas exploiting chemical reactions are introduced. Many R\&D issues are suggested by this new concept.},

The outer electron of the colliding system is described in the zero-range potential approximation, the relevant parameters of which are extracted from an ab initio calculation of the (HHe) - molecular ion. This enables an exact treatment of the bound-state-continuum transitions induced by the nuclear motion. A very efficient approximation is also proposed to solve the collision problem. A detailed picture of the final state of the system is thus obtained (differential cross sections, total cross sections, spectra of ejected electrons, isotope effect) and compared with experimental data when available.},
